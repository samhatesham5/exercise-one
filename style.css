/* ==Styling the interior now===

Margin and padding is calculated in a box (top, right, bottom, left) 

So if you wrote margin like...

margin: 0 auto 0 auto; -- Means 0 applies to the top, auto to the right, 0 to the bottom, auto to the left 

Kinda like you're going clockwise

What auto does is back fills all the margin in that space, which is good for layout 

Works best with max-width and means that it'll remain in a spot regardless of the width of screen
 In short, auto on left and right will be responsive, expanding to at most 1200px (default screen)
 
 And 10px on top and bottom means that when you shrink or expand it, it will remain 10px
